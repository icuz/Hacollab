## Working methodology

 The working methodology of Hacollab, the app that shows current hackathons and has a notification feature, would involve several key steps. Here's an overview of how the app would work:
    1.Search and discovery: The app would provide a platform for students to search for hackathons happening in their college and nearby. The hackathons could be filtered based on location, date, and theme, making it easy for students to find events that match their interests and skills.

    2.Notification system: Students can set notifications for hackathons they are interested in and receive updates regarding the event, such as the deadline for submitting entries and other important information. The app would send reminders about the deadlines for submitting entries, ensuring that students do not miss out on any crucial updates.

    3.Collaboration: The app would have a participant list where students can connect with each other, discuss ideas, and form teams. This feature would be especially useful for students who are looking to participate in a hackathon but do not have a team to work with.

    4.Hackathons hosting: The app would provide students with the ability to host hackathons. This would give students an idea of the level of competition they would face and provide them with inspiration for their own projects.

    5.Request help: we can also request help from the users for a help in the project we are working on.We can simply post the issue/help details to post it and users can opt to help via filling the google form.

In conclusion, Hacollab's working methodology involves providing students with a platform to search for and participate in hackathons, receiving updates and reminders about the events, connecting with other students to collaborate, and viewing information about hackathons to gain inspiration.
